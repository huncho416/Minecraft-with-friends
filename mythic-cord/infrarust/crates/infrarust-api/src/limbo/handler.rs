/// Limbo handlers are chained in order as configured per-server. The proxy
/// handles the Minecraft protocol (`JoinGame`, `KeepAlive`, chunks) — the
/// handler only provides the game logic.
///
/// Methods use [`BoxFuture`] to allow dyn-dispatch (`Box<dyn LimboHandler>`).
/// Implement by returning `Box::pin(async move { ... })`.
///
/// # Example
/// ```ignore
/// use infrarust_api::prelude::*;
///
/// struct AuthHandler;
///
/// impl LimboHandler for AuthHandler {
///     fn name(&self) -> &str { "auth" }
///
///     fn on_player_enter<'a>(&'a self, session: &'a dyn LimboSession) -> BoxFuture<'a, HandlerResult> {
///         Box::pin(async move {
///             session.send_title(TitleData::new(
///                 Component::text("Please login").color("gold"),
///                 Component::text("/login <password>").color("gray"),
///             )).ok();
